## Warnings

1. Best to be used on desktop with resolution 1920x1080 (cuz my responsive skills aint that great)
2. Developed on Google Chrome

## How It Works

1. Users sign up to create personalized accounts, establishing a digital space for their gym needs
2. Once registered, users now can access the schedule page where they can add their schedule that they can track it whenever they need
3. You can now post a blog in the blog page where you can Edit/Delete your own blogs, you can comment and delete the comment that you posted
4. Classes/Programs page is not functional, only basic routing.
